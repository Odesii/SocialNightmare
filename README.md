_Skip this README at your own peril—it's like ignoring the warning label on a firework. Surprisingly common and mildly entertaining for the bystanders._

## Overview

Welcome to the **Social Nightmare API**, where your dreams of creating a social network turn into a cyber nightmare. I’m sure you’ll glance at this README, then ignore it, and still wonder why your code doesn't work. Bravo.

## Features

- **Express.js** for routing. You know, because you can't do it yourself.
- **MongoDB** for handling your unstructured data mess.
- **Mongoose ODM** to make your life somewhat easier. Not that you'll appreciate it.
- CRUD operations for users and thoughts, plus reactions and friend lists. It's not rocket science, but it might be for you.

## Installation

Oh joy, here we go. Follow these steps, if you dare:

1. Clone the repo. Not that you’ll understand what you’re cloning.
	- `git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-nightmare-api.git`
    
2. Navigate to the project directory. Simple enough, right?
	- `cd social-nightmare-api`
    
3. Install the dependencies. But hey, you’ll probably miss this step.
	- `npm install`
    
4. Make sure MongoDB is installed and running. Oh, you haven’t installed it yet? Figures.
    
- Start the server. If you get this far, I’m genuinely impressed.
	* `npm start`

Honestly, it's better for both of us if you don't try to contact me. If you're desperate, scream into the void; it's just as effective and significantly less annoying for me.
